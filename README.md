# Web Application for Posting Real Estate Ads

I created a web application that allows users to post and browse ads for real estate properties, such as houses, apartments, and land. The application is designed to help buyers and sellers find each other and communicate easily. The application has the following features:

- Data binding using Angular, a popular framework for building dynamic web applications
- Image handling using Cloudinary, a cloud-based service that optimizes and delivers images
- Ready for deployment using Azure, a cloud computing platform that provides various services and tools
- Secure app settings using Azure Key Vault, a service that stores and manages secrets such as passwords and keys
- Authorization and authentication using IdentityServer4, an open source framework that implements OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 protocols
- Middleware and exception handling using ASP.NET Core, a cross-platform framework for building web applications and APIs
- Automapper, Put and Patch methods for updating data, using a library that simplifies object mapping and HTTP verbs that modify resources
- UnitOfWork and Repository patterns for data access, using design patterns that abstract and encapsulate data operations
- API, EntityFramework, and SQL Server for data storage, using a software interface that defines the contract for data exchange, an object-relational mapper that simplifies data access, and a relational database management system
- Sorting and filtering functionality for ads, using custom logic and parameters that allow users to narrow down their search results
- Resolver and property-detail page for displaying ad details, using a service that pre-fetches data before navigating to a route and a component that shows the information and images of a selected property
- Properties adding functionality for creating new ads, using a form that collects the data and images of a new property and validates the input
- Json data, list property, validation, ngx-bootstrap for UI design, using a lightweight data format, a component that displays the properties in a grid or list view, a process that checks the correctness of the input, and a library that integrates Bootstrap with Angular
- Services, user login, alertify, and ngx-bootstrap for user interaction, using classes that provide reusable functionality, a component that authenticates the user and stores the token, a library that displays notifications and alerts, and a library that provides UI components such as modals and tooltips
- Reactive forms and validation for user input, using a model-driven approach that creates and manipulates form control objects and a process that checks the validity of the input
- HTML form with Angular additions for user registration, using a template-driven approach that binds the form elements to the data model and adds directives and validators
- Page routing for navigation, using a service that maps the URL to a component and enables transitions between views

I created this project based on a course, but I also added some features by myself. I learned a lot from this project and I improved my skills in web development.
